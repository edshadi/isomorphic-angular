#Isomorphic Angular
WORK IN PROGRESS
Inspired by Airbnb's Rendr and isomorphic javascript, I hope to use Angular on the server and the client. While there are some solutions out there, none of them appeal to me due to either performance or heavy dependecies.

##Want to play?
Please do, I'm still in the experimental process and I love playing, so hit me up :)
